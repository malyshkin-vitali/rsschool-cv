        <h2>Summary</h2>
        <hr/>
        <p>I have been interesting in computers since my childhood. I want to try become a programmer, because I like use
            many apps in computer and I want to understand how do they work. At my PC now I use ArchLinux(with Windows 10
            dualboot for special geodesy programms and CAD programms) as a operating system. I got acquainted with Linux in
            2011, my firt distibution of Linux was Ubuntu 11.10. Unfortunnaly I didn't have a big experince in installing
            OS's and deep knowleadges aboud hard disks file system, so my firtst experiance was bad - I removed my
            Window-ntfs partition;) But I didn't give up and installed Windows again. Then I installed Ubuntu and started to
            use it. It was very unwonted, I went deeper and deeper and I liked the concept of Linux and the Opensource
            community more and more. I very amazed of Opensource projects like GNU/Linux, LibreOffice,
            Telegram-desktop. </p>
