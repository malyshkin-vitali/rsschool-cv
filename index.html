      <h2>Summary</h2>
      <hr />
      <p>I have been interesting in computers since my childhood. I want to try become a programmer, because I like use many apps in computer and I want to understand how do they work. At my PC now I use ArchLinux(with Windows 10 dualboot for special geodesy programms and CAD programms) as a operating system. I got acquainted with Linux in 2011, my firt distibution of Linux was Ubuntu 11.10. Unfortunnaly I didn't have a big experince in installing OS's and deep knowleadges aboud hard disks file system, so my firtst experiance was bad - I removed my Window-ntfs partition;) But I didn't give up and installed Windows again. Then I installed Ubuntu and started to use it. It was very unwonted, I went deeper and deeper and I liked the concept of Linux and the Opensource community more and more. I very amazed of Opensource projects like GNU/Linux, LibreOffice, Telegram-desktop. </p>
