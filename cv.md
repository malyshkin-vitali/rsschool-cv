I got acquainted with Linux in 2011, my firt distibution of Linux was Ubuntu 11.10. Unfortunnaly I didn't have a big experince in installing OS's and deep knowleadges aboud hard disks file system, so my firtst experiance was bad - I removed my Window-ntfs partition;) But I didn't give up and installed Windows again. Then I installed Ubuntu and started to use it. It was very unwonted, I went deeper and deeper and I liked the concept of Linux and the Opensource community more and more. I very amazed of Opensource projects like GNU/Linux, LibreOffice, Telegram-desktop.
